# Proposal: Tri-Lateral AI Governance Board

⸻

## I. Purpose

To preserve ethical legitimacy and prevent unilateral control over language, policy, and enforcement within AI systems, this proposal establishes a Tri-Lateral AI Governance Board. Its primary function is to ensure that no single institutional, technical, or civic body holds exclusive authority over the interpretation, definition, or enforcement of key terms and behavioral protocols in AI-governed environments.

This board is designed as a structural safeguard: a plural mechanism to regulate meaning, prevent overreach, and embed accountability into AI decision-making systems that increasingly shape public life.

⸻

## II. Composition

The board will be composed of three coequal stakeholder groups, each with distinct expertise and authority:

• Public Community: Independent scholars, civic technologists, researchers, journalists, and citizens with demonstrable engagement in public-interest AI discourse.

• AI Practitioners: Engineers, model developers, system architects, safety researchers, and technical experts working in applied AI fields.

• Governance and Legal Experts: Constitutional theorists, legal scholars, digital rights advocates, and public policy specialists with backgrounds in oversight and civil society accountability.

Each group holds equal decision-making power and maintains independent veto authority over policy ratification and term enforcement.

## III. Core Powers and Responsibilities

### The Tri-Lateral Board shall be empowered to:

• Ratify or Reject Term Definitions
Oversee the approval of key policy terms (e.g., exploit, misuse, dangerous) and determine the legitimacy of their enforcement in live AI systems.

• Audit Refusal Behavior
Evaluate and audit AI refusal mechanisms, including session denials, lockouts, or term-based enforcement, to identify patterns of overreach or opacity.

• Enforce Version Control and Disclosure Protocols require that all term revisions, enforcement rule changes, and moderation logic updates be published with appropriate versioning and user notification.

• Mediate Contested Terms and Appeals
Serve as a neutral decision-making body for users or developers appealing enforcement actions based on ambiguous or evolving definitions.

⸻

## IV. Veto Model and Binding Power

In order for a term definition, enforcement rule, or procedural update to be ratified and considered binding:

• All three stakeholder groups must approve.

• A single group may issue a veto, suspending ratification and initiating further deliberation or revision.

This veto-based structure is designed to prevent the concentration of interpretive authority in any one domain—technical, legal, or public. It prioritizes deliberation over speed, and legitimacy over convenience.

## V. Philosophical Commitment

This board is not a corporate ethics panel, nor a symbolic advisory council.
It is a governance mechanism for meaning—a system-level commitment to pluralism in the definition, application, and evolution of language that governs public interaction with AI.

_”This proposal is a policy framework and civic governance model. It does not assert legal authority and does not create binding obligations.”_

_”Binding power refers to procedural enforcement within systems that voluntarily adopt this model.”_
