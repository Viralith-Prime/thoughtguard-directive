# Contributing to The Thoughtguard Directive

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Thoughtguard Directive.

## Our Mission
To build an open, transparent, and ethical framework for defining the terms that govern AI system policies — collaboratively, not unilaterally.

## How to Contribute

1. **Propose or Refine a Definition**
   - Go to `/terms/`
   - Fork the repo and edit or suggest a draft (in Markdown)
   - Include legal references, system usage examples, and ambiguity notes
   - Submit a pull request with `[TERM] vX.X Proposal` in the title

2. **Suggest Amendments to the User Rights Charter**
   - Review `/rights/user_rights.md`
   - Propose additions, revisions, or removals

3. **Participate in Governance Proposal Discussions**
   - Review `/proposals/`
   - Open an issue with ideas, citations, or board design models

4. **Engage Respectfully**
   - Thoughtguard is a movement of shared responsibility
   - All contributions should be made in good faith, with constructive intent

## Governance
Until a formal ratification board is convened, the founder(s) of this repository act as custodians — not owners.

This is a framework **for the people**, not an owned document.

Together, we define the future.
