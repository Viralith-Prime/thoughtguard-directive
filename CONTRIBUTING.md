# Contributing to The Thoughtguard Directive

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Thoughtguard Directive.

## Our Mission
To build an open, transparent, and ethical framework for defining the terms that govern AI system policies — collaboratively, not unilaterally.

## How We Work

This repository uses a **flat file structure** on the `main` branch only. No pull request is too small, and all input is considered.

### How to Contribute

1. **Propose or Edit a Term**
   - Open or edit an existing `.md` file (e.g., `exploit.md`, `dangerous.md`)
   - Include legal references, system usage examples, and ambiguity concerns
   - Submit a pull request with `[TERM] vX.X Proposal` in the title

2. **Refine the Governance Model**
   - Edit `trilateral_board.md` or `process.md`
   - Suggest changes to board structure, ratification steps, or oversight protocols

3. **Edit or Expand the Rights Charter**
   - Open `user_rights.md`
   - Add suggestions inline or via pull request

4. **Start a Discussion**
   - Use GitHub Issues to debate a term, appeal a definition, or raise governance questions

## Best Practices

- Keep proposals concise and backed by references
- Tag your pull requests clearly
- Link related Issues whenever possible

This framework is open, versioned, and made for all.  
Welcome aboard.

## Governance
Until a formal ratification board is convened, the founder(s) of this repository act as custodians — not owners.

This is a framework **for the people**, not an owned document.

Together, we define the future.
